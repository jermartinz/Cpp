## 📌 Description
This repository documents my personal journey of learning and practicing **C++**.  
It contains exercises, mini-projects, and examples that cover:
- C++ fundamentals and syntax
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Data structures and algorithms
- Memory management
- File handling
- Modern C++ features (STL, templates, smart pointers)

The goal is to build a **solid foundation** for creating high-performance applications and understanding both low-level and high-level concepts of the language.
