# 📘 Jumping into C++ – Progress Tracker

This folder tracks my work based on the edition structured like the screenshot:
- **Part 1: Jumping into C++**
- **Part 2: Working with Data**
- **Part 3: Writing Larger Programs**
- **Part 4: Miscellaneous Topics**

I will implement **examples**, **exercises**, and **mini‑projects** chapter by chapter, adding brief notes when needed.
